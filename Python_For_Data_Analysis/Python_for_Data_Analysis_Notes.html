  <h1>I. Essential Python Libraries</h1>
        
    <h2>Numpy</h2>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>A Fast and efficient multidimensional array object <i>ndarray</i> </li>
        <li>Functions for performing element-wise computations with arrays or mathematical operations between arrays.</li>
        <li>Tools for reading and writing array-based datasets to disk</li>
        <li>Linear algebra operations, Fourier transform, and random number generations</li>
        <li>A mature C API to enable Python extensions and native C or C++ code to access NumPy's data structures and computational</li>
      </ol>
    
    <h2>Pandas</h2>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Provides high-level data structures and functions designed to make working with structured or tabular data fast, easy, and expressive.</li>
        <li>Since its emergence in 2010, it has helped enable Python to be a powerful and productive data analysis environment.</li>
        <li>The Primary objects in pandas that will be used in this book are the <i>DataFrame</i>, a tabular, column-oriented data structure with both row and column labels, and the <i>Series</i>, a one-dimensional labeled array objects</li>
        <li>pandas blends the high-performance, array-computing ideas of NumPy with the flexible data manipulation capabilities of spreadsheets and relational databases (such as SQL).</li>
        <li>It provides sophisticated indexing functionality to make it easy to reshape, slice and dice, perform aggregations, and select subsets.</li>
        <li>Since data manipulation preparation, and cleaning is such an important skill in data analysis, pandas is one of the primary focuses of this book.</li>
      </ol>
